Java (Indonesian: Jawa) is an island of Indonesia, bordered by the Indian Ocean on the south and the Java Sea on the north.
With a population of over 141 million (Java only) or 145 million (including the inhabitants of its surrounding islands),
Java has 56.7 percent of the Indonesian population and is the world's most populous island.[1] The Indonesian capital city,
Jakarta, is located on its northwestern coast. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the centre of powerful
Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the
Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally.
Four of Indonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: Ujung Kulon National Park, Borobudur Temple,
Prambanan Temple, and Sangiran Early Man Site.
